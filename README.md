STRATEGIC INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
Overview
This project utilizes Machine Learning and computer vision to build a strategic inventory management and clothing recommendation system for retailers. It leverages live camera feeds to classify customer age and gender, providing personalized clothing recommendations while assisting vendors with inventory management.

Features:
Real-Time Age and Gender Detection: Using a live camera feed integrated into a web app, the system detects customer age and gender in real time.
Clothing Recommendation: Based on the detected age and gender, appropriate clothing recommendations are displayed for the customer.
Inventory Insights for Vendors: The system helps vendors optimize inventory management and plan efficient cloth placement based on customer preferences.
Key Components
1. Customer Detection and Clothing Recommendation
Real-Time Age and Gender Detection:
Technologies Used
Machine Learning: CNNs using the Caffe model for age and gender classification.
Web Framework: Django for building the web application.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for live display of clothing recommendations.
Backend: Django and Python for managing image processing and inventory logic.
Camera Integration: Webcam or external camera feed integrated with the web app.
Future Enhancements
Integration with Online Stores to synchronize inventory and customer recommendations.
Improved Recommendation Logic using customer purchase history and behavior data.
Advanced Analytics to provide shop owners with deep insights into sales and customer demographics.

The system uses a live camera feed to capture images of customers when they enter the store.
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained using the Caffe framework, is employed to classify the customer's age and gender.
This classification enables the system to profile customers and provide tailored recommendations.
Personalized Clothing Recommendations:

Once the customer's age and gender are identified, the system suggests relevant clothing items from the store's inventory.
Recommendations are based on the customer’s demographic and may also consider store-specific criteria, like sales trends or seasonal availability.
2. Inventory Management and Cloth Placement for Vendors
Inventory Monitoring:

The system tracks inventory in real time, providing insights into stock levels and restocking needs.
Vendors receive alerts when specific items (especially high-demand ones) need to be replenished.
Cloth Placement Optimization:

The system suggests the optimal arrangement of clothing items in the store based on customer preferences.
This involves arranging high-demand and frequently recommended items in visible areas to maximize sales.

How It Works
Live Camera Integration: A camera is connected to the web app (built with Django) to capture customer images as they walk in.

Age and Gender Classification: The images are processed using a CNN model deployed through the Caffe framework to classify customers based on their age group and gender.

Recommendation Display: Based on the classification results, the system recommends clothing options, which are displayed on digital screens in-store. These recommendations are tailored to each customer’s demographic profile.

Inventory Management: The system tracks inventory changes in real time and provides the vendor with insights on product placement and restocking needs.
